Oat hulls are not only a valuable source of dietary fiber but also play a crucial role in the production of animal feed and various industrial applications. The market is expected to grow due to rising demand in both food and feed sectors, as consumers become more health-conscious and seek natural ingredients.</p>    <p>Market research indicates that the global oat hulls market was valued at approximately <strong>$120 million</strong> in 2023. This growth trajectory can be attributed to their incorporation in functional foods and the rising popularity of oat-based products.
